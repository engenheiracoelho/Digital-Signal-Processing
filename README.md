# Digital Signal Processing

The experiments were created in the discipline of Digital Signal Processing in the Telecommunications Engineering course of the Federal Institute of Santa Catarina - IFSC.

Matlab software was used to execute the codes.

## Laboratory:

* [AE1](https://github.com/leticiacoelho/PSD/tree/master/AE1): Signal and System review.

* [AE2](https://github.com/leticiacoelho/PSD/tree/master/AE2): Digital Filter IIR (Infinite Impulse Response).

* [AE3](https://github.com/leticiacoelho/PSD/tree/master/AE3): Digital Filter FIR (Finite Impulse Response).

* [AE4](https://github.com/leticiacoelho/PSD/tree/master/AE4): Digital Filter FIR and IIR (*Using Filter Designer Toolbox - MATLAB*).

* [AE5](https://github.com/leticiacoelho/PSD/tree/master/AE5):  DTMF Detector (*Using MODELSIM-MATLAB*).
